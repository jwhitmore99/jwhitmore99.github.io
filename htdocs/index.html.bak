<h1>Jackson Whitmore</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Jackson and I'm an Oregonian that likes off-roading, games, camping, and guitar. I graduated high school when I was 16, then went to lane community college until I graduated at 19 with a transfer degree. I still didn't know what I wanted to do then, so I decided to go to a trade school to be a lineman. I graduated there and worked in the field during the year 2020. In 2021, I quit the lineman field and I worked for a HVAC startup under an engineer, who sent me on my path to become an engineer today. That's how I got to GCU. </p>
